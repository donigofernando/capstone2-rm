Hola!
This is Capstone 2 Project in Data Science Bootcamp hosted by Algoritma Data Science.

This R-based project uses several regression model, such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, and chooses the best model to be used to predict concrete strength. The conclusion here is Random Forest with number = 9 and repeat = 5 are the best model. 

Thank you for seeing this code!
Hope your best comments to be my evaluation!
